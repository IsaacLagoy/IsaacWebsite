        The Google Maps Finder is hosted on <a href='/jobs/structurology' class='underline hover-blue'>Structurology</a>'s Jarvis Website that I was working on towards the end of the summer. Unfortunately, I was unable to add the second tool I was working on, an ASCE Hazard Report Tool, to the website due to time restrictions and issues with hosting the website on Vercel, the platform that this website is hosted on.
