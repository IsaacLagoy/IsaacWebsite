        <p>I started working with iStar, under <a href='https://engineering.tamu.edu/etid/profiles/hammad-eman.html' class='underline hover-blue'>Dr. Eman Hammad</a>, during the spring 2024 semester doing a combination of IT and web development. I worked on the Cyber Expert Project Team where we designed a website to host virtual labs for students and monitor their engagement.</p>
